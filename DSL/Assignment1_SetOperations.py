'''
In second year computer engineering class, group A studentâ€™s play cricket, group B students
play badminton and group C students play football. Write a Python program using functions
to compute following: - a) List of students who play both cricket and badminton b) List of
students who play either cricket or badminton but not both c) Number of students who play
neither cricket nor badminton d) Number of students who play cricket and football but not
badminton. (Note- While realizing the group, duplicate entries should be avoided, Do not
use SET built-in functions)
